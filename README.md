## Exploring the Bioconductor universe, its representations of data, and its methodologies.

Exploring the Bioconductor universe, its representations of data, and its
methodologies. Mostly consists of vignettes exploring various aspects of
Bioconductor, plus potentially some code and data to use in those vignettes,
or code to download data for big things.This is just for my personal benefit.
If you find it useful, great. Note: It may change or disappear without notice.
