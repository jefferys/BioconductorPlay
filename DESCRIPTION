Description: Exploring the Bioconductor universe, its representations of data,
    and its methodologies. Mostly consists of vignettes exploring various
    aspects of Bioconductor, plus potentially some code and data to use in
    those vignettes, or code to download data for big things.This is just for
    my personal benefit. If you find it useful, great. Note: It may change or
    disappear without notice.
